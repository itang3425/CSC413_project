**Meeting Dates:** [Mon Nov 24 / Thu Nov 27]  
**Team Members Present:** Lawrence Gordon Fu, Xiaohan Tang, Ruili Xu

## 🔹 1. Progress Summary
Summarize what was accomplished since last meeting.

- Lawrence:
- Ruili: 
  1. retrained LoRA. generated a few images, there is smthing very wrong.
  2. rent a high GPU performance server to better train the model.
- Xiaohan: 
- Shared work / joint debugging / model training updates

**Key Results:**
- Model accuracy / loss trend:
  - for LoRA **training**, probably due to the dataset is whatever image with the same
  "genshin-style character", the model didnt seem to capture the pattern well.
  - when **inferencing**, tried with prompt 
    - "genshen-style character". 
    the model even has some problem with generating an proper anime human.
    - "genshen style anime boy".
    the model at least generated a proper anime boy, the art style isn't too far away.
  - **conclusion**: will try to use image and text being more precise description on the
    character, with an extra tag "genshen-style", see how that works.
- Dataset updates or preprocessing results:
- New experiments tried:

## 🔹 2. Issues / Challenges
Record blockers, failed experiments, or conceptual problems.

- [ ] Example: training diverged after LR=1e-3
- [ ] Example: dataset imbalance between classes
- [ ] Example: Colab runtime limits during training
Besides the text prompt, we also need a pooled embeddings for the pipeline.
