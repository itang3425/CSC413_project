# 🧾 CSC413 Weekly Meeting Report

**Week:** [ Week 2 Meeting 2 — Nov 20, 2025]  
**Meeting Dates:** [Mon Nov 17 / Thu Nov 20]  
**Team Members Present:** Lawrence Gordon Fu, Xiaohan Tang, Ruili Xu

---

## 🔹 1. Progress Summary
Summarize what was accomplished since last meeting.

- Lawrence:
- Ruili: Train LoRA. But later found out that was with the wrong text. (trained with
character's name but should use the same "genshen-style character")
- Xiaohan: Finished building the pipeline
- Shared work / joint debugging / model training updates

**Key Results:**
- Model accuracy / loss trend:
- Dataset updates or preprocessing results:
- New experiments tried:

---

## 🔹 2. Issues / Challenges
Record blockers, failed experiments, or conceptual problems.

- [ ] Example: training diverged after LR=1e-3
- [ ] Example: dataset imbalance between classes
- [ ] Example: Colab runtime limits during training
Besides the text prompt, we also need a pooled embeddings for the pipeline.

---

## 🔹 3. Next Steps
Define action items for the coming week.

- Lawrence: Train MLP and obtain CLIP embeddings
- Ruili:  Retrain LoRA with the correct text related. See how the model goes.
- Xiaohan: integrate all models into the pipeline

---

## 🔹 4. Reflections / Discussion Notes
Notes on what you learned, questions for the TA, or design decisions.

- Observation on model behavior:
- Discussion on architecture change:
- Questions for next TA check-in:
